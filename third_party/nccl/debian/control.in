Description: NVIDIA Collectives Communication Library (NCCL) Runtime
 NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a stand-alone library of standard collective
 communication routines for GPUs, such as all-gather, reduce, broadcast, etc.,
 that have been optimized to achieve high bandwidth over PCIe. NCCL supports up
 to eight GPUs and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI)
 applications.
